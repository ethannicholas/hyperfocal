# Engine performance notes

Living reference for fusion-performance work: where the time goes, what has been
tried and rejected, and how to measure. ROADMAP.md keeps the forward *goal*
(hit the throughput bar); the data and dead-ends live here so the roadmap stays
skimmable.

## Measurement environment

Numbers below come from the 2-core / 8 GB ARM64 dev VM (details in the
build-machine notes) and are **relative, not absolute** — perf targets are
hardware-relative (the bar is commercial-stacker speed on the *same* machine),
and real hardware will differ. The VM also drifts slower over a long session, so
only interleaved A/Bs settle close calls.

Sampling profilers can't run in the VM (the hypervisor doesn't virtualize the
profiling interrupt — WPA/VS/Superluminal all need it); use instrumented
decomposition (phase buckets + scratch benches). On real Windows hardware,
`wpr` + WPA symbolize with `swift build -Xswiftc -debug-info-format=codeview
-Xlinker /DEBUG`.

## Throughput bar

**< 2 min end-to-end** on the reference stacks (measured against commercial
stackers on the VM). pmax is close; dmap has further to go.

### 11 MP reference — 82 × 11 MP JPEGs: dmap ~175 s, pmax ~132 s

- **Registration 46–48 s** = SIFT detect ~32 s (DoG pyramid dominates — the
  2000-keypoint cap is *not* the wall) + match ~14 s + decode/gradient glue
  ~2.5 s (down from ~15 s before the ¼-scale JPEG gray decode). **A genuinely
  cheaper feature detector is the biggest remaining prize.**
- **Warp** 59 s (pmax) / 71 s (dmap; the ~12 s delta is async spill I/O taxing
  compute). The loop is at its practical floor — SIMD8 pair taps, cost split
  ~41 ns/px (weights ~16, taps ~7, homography/divides/clamp/store ~19; scalar
  LUT weights beat vectorized — SIMD8<Int32> conversion inits are unspecialized
  generics). Dead ends recorded in `WarpBench.swift` (`debug-bench warp`); don't
  expect more here without changing outputs.
- **dmap spill round-trip** — io ~42 s (fp16, overlapped under compute) +
  render-src ~18 s reading it back.
- **energy ~16 s**; select/regularize/render ~7 s.

### 45 MP reference — 10 × 45 MP DNG (`~/Desktop/Fluorite`): dmap ~295 s

Achieved after (a) registration gray decoding RAW at LibRaw half-size (124 → 30 s
registration) and (b) a **proportional spill margin** `max(2 GB, spill/2)` — a
flat 2 GB margin let a 7.3 GB fp32 spill drive the volume to 97 % full, where
write latency collapses (2124 s vs 469 s forced-fp16; fp16 matches real content
at 95.9 dB, far better than the 79.5 dB synth characterization).

Remaining walls, in order: warp ~86 s (memory-pressure-inflated, ~2× the bench
rate; 4.9 GB peak on 8 GB), spill io ~48 s + render-src ~33 s (fp16), energy
~28 s, decode-blocked ~44 s (LibRaw full demosaic ×1 for fusion — prefetch can't
fully hide ~11 s/frame on 2 cores), registration 30 s. **At this size,
frames-at-once *memory* (not time) is the likelier next lever.**

## Measured dead ends (don't re-try without new hardware or evidence)

- **Spill byte-reduction** (RGB + 8-bit-alpha slot layout, 13 B/px fp32 /
  7 B/px fp16, bit-identical fp32 round-trip proven): net-negative on the 2-core
  VM at 11 MP — write io is cache/flush-governed, not byte-proportional (~41–48 s
  regardless), and the strided pack cost +3 s convert plus inflated warp +4–9 s
  (2-core memory-bandwidth interference). Parked in the local `spill-rgb` stash;
  its −19 % fp32 footprint may pay on real hardware or at 45 MP (io term 3×
  larger, fp16 auto-selected) — measure there first. `HYPERFOCAL_SPILL_FP16=1`
  forces the degraded tier for controlled A/Bs (~79.5 dB synth).
- **Metal GPUDMap zero-copy upload** — see the ROADMAP item. Two findings:
  `[Float]` elements live at offset 32 past the storage base, so
  `makeBuffer(bytesNoCopy:)` can never page-align without reworking
  `ImageBuffer`'s storage; and the warp bucket is dominated by system memory
  pressure (25–49 s swings between identical-code runs on the 4–5 GB working
  set), not the ~1–2 s memcpy — re-measure on quiet hardware before investing.

## Ablation / measurement taps

- `hyperfocal-cli -v` prints phase buckets; `compare` handles differently-cropped
  outputs of the same scene (`Metrics.psnrIntersection`) — use it for
  registration A/Bs.
- Env switches: `HYPERFOCAL_SIFT_NFEATURES` / `HYPERFOCAL_SIFT_CONTRAST` /
  `HYPERFOCAL_REGISTER_MAXSIDE` (needs `HYPERFOCAL_REGISTER_FULLGRAY=1` to ablate
  above the decode scale) / `HYPERFOCAL_REGISTER_DEBUG` /
  `HYPERFOCAL_DECODE_DEBUG` / `HYPERFOCAL_SPILL_DEBUG`.
- **Registration scale floor** is `max(1200, longest/5)`: flat-1200 *failed* the
  45 MP Mac A/B, while the 1600 bound + 2000-kp cap verified quality-neutral. The
  gray-decode policy mirrors the `/5` term (see `Aligner.openCVRegisterMaxSide`
  and the `registrationDecodeMinLongest` comments).

## The per-pixel specialization contract (read before touching a hot loop)

Cross-file generic calls don't specialize in SwiftPM per-file debug builds — that
trap cost **55×** in the warp. Use concrete-typed helpers only (see
`PortableSIMD.swift`'s header contract). On Apple `-O`, also watch for the
stdlib's generic `pointwiseMin`/`Max` staying witness-dispatched (concrete
`hfMin`/`hfMax` fixes it bit-identically; the trap is toolchain-specific and was
neutral on Swift 6.3.3/Windows).
